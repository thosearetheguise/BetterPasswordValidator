# BetterPasswordValidator
An all-in-one class library for use in validating and encouraging more secure passwords.

The goal of this project is to create an all-in-one class library that can be used in applications to perform better password validation than the OOB alternative.

The functions of this class library aim to help teach developers about the new [NIST Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) as well as provide feedback to users encouraging them to think about the passwords they create and educate them in better password generation techniques.

We will be streaming most of this projects development over on Twitch at https://www.twitch.tv/thosearetheguys/ come join us to hang out, help contribute to the solution or just bant about info sec, programming or general nerd stuff.

## TODO
* Lots at this stage
* Possibly a built-in secure password generator

## Credit
Parts of the Class Library utilise the *Have I Been Pwned API v2* (https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) to perform checks against previous account breaches and password leaks.
